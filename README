Seife

Seife is a simple soap tool for testing or for integration 
The programm is so easy that you can implement the idea in any language in real world applications.

What is soap ?
Soap is a kind of communication protokoll which is based on xml.
In 99% it uses http post request to communicate.
It calls remote methods (defined in the xml) which return a result. There are a lot of frameworks around soap but mainly its a simple http post to a http adress, which can even be done with curl.

The idea behind seife is to define a soap request in a file as a template, to fill out the template and post it.
The template can be filled out for example in seife with the ruby ERB Parser.
Now a response comes back. This response can be parsed by dom or simply by regex.
In practice I use soapui to get the request content which I copy and paste in the request file for seife, Then the placeholders for the parser are inserted.
There is one example in seife.

Seife is not a programm out of the box. It is an idea to deal with soap without the complexity of a fully featured framework.

tserv.rb is a testserver (you need the sinatra gem) to which can be posted
